Before diving into Langium itself, let's get your environment ready for development:

1. You have a working [Node environment](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with version 16 or higher.
2. Install Yeoman and the Langium extension generator.

```bash
npm i -g yo generator-langium
```

For our getting started example, we would also recommend you to install the latest version of [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
