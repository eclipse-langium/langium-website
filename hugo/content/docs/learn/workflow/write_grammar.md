Your Langium project is now setup and ready to be used. The next step is to define the grammar of your language. The grammar is the most important part of your language definition. It defines the syntax of your language and how the language elements are structured.

The grammar is defined in a `.langium` file. Make sure that you have installed the VS Code extension for Langium. This extension provides syntax highlighting and code completion for `.langium` files.
